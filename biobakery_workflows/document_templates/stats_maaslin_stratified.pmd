The abundance for the <%= vars["top_pathways"] %> most significant associations for each of the categorical features are plotted stratified by species. These plots were generated with the utility script included with HUMAnN named humann_barplot.

```{python, echo=False, results="md", name="show stratified pathways plots"}
utilities.show_stratified_plots(vars["stratified_pathways_plots"])
```
