We welcome feedback and issue reporting for all bioBakery tools through our [Discourse site](https://forum.biobakery.org/c/pull-request/featurepull-request/). For users that would like to directly contribute to the [tools](https://github.com/biobakery/) we are happy to field PRs to address **bug fixes**. Please note the turn around time on our end might be a bit long to field these but that does not mean we don't value the contribution! We currently **don't** accept PRs to add **new functionality** to tools but we would be happy to receive your feedback on [Discourse](https://forum.biobakery.org/c/pull-request/featurepull-request/).

Also, we will make sure to attribute your contribution in our Userâ€™s manual(README.md) and in any associated paper Acknowledgements.
